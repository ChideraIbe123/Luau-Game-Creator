It is critical to recognize that energy-\\nefficient equipment and products may cost the company more initially but that the lasting \\nsavings gained from their use will save more money over time.  \\n• Make energy management a continuous process \\nSuccessful energy management involves more than just installing a few energy-efficient \\ntechnologies. It involves establishing a co mmitted company-wide program to manage \\nenergy continuously as a function of your business. It’s an ongoing process that involves: \\n• understanding your energy use, \\n• setting goals, \\n• implementing good operational and maintenance practices, \\n• making behavioral changes, \\n• tracking and benchmarking energy use, and \\n• involving every employee. \\nENERGY STAR works with leadin g industrial manufacturers to identify the basic aspects of \\neffective energy management programs.2 Figure 2 depicts the major steps.  \\nFigure 2.

      "\t* **Implement control strategies for plug loads**: As mentioned earlier, automatic receptacle control is required by code, and extending controls to more than 50% of relevant areas can help reduce plug load energy consumption. Consider implementing additional controls, such as occupancy sensors or smart thermostats, to optimize HVAC system performance and reduce waste.\n",
